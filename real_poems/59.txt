Your picture smiles as first it smiled;
    The ring you gave is still the same;
Your letter tells, O changing child!
    No tidings since it came.

Give me an amulet
    That keeps intelligence with you,â€”
Red when you love, and rosier red,
    And when you love not, pale and blue.

Alas! that neither bonds nor vows
    Can certify possession;
Torments me still the fear that love
    Died in its last expression.
