Amor, Amor, the clouds in the sky’s tower
mounted like triumphant purifying fountains,
and all glowed blue, all was star-like:
sea, boat, day, fused and banished.

Come and see the cherries of water that appeared,
and the whole scale of the swift universe,
come and touch the fire of the blue instant,
come before its petals are consumed.

Nothing here lacks light, number, clusters,
space opened up by the wind’s virtues,
until it delivers the sea-foam’s last secret.

And among so many blues, celestial, submerged,
our eyes are lost barely divining
the powers of air, the underwater gushers.
