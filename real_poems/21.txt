One time more, my love, the net of light extinguishes
work, wheels, flames, boredoms and farewells,
and we surrender the swaying wheat to night,
the wheat that noon stole from earth and light.

The moon alone in the midst of its clear page
sustains the pillars of Heavenâ€™s Bay,
the room acquires the slowness of gold,
and your hands go here and there preparing night.

O love, O night. O cupola ringed by a river
of impenetrable water in the shadows of Heaven,
that raises and drowns its tempestuous orbs,
until we are only the one dark space
a glass into which fall celestial ashes,
one drop in the flow of a vast slow river.
