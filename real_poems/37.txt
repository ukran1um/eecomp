Glorious Mind, bright daemon
of absolute clusters, of honest noon,
here we are at last, without solitude and alone,
far from the delirium of the savage city.

When the pure line surrounds its dove
and the fire honours peace with its fuel
you and I exalt this heavenly outcome.
Mind and Love live naked in this house.

Furious dreams, rivers of bitter certainty,
decisions harder than the sleep of a hammer
fell into the double glass of the lovers,

until the Twins, Mind and Love,
were lifted on the scale like two wings.
Like this the Transparency built itself.
