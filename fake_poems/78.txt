Eve’s garment unfurls in dusk’s quiet grove,
among the susurrus of viridescent spires—
I am the pulse, the exhale of fleeting light;
a beat within the petrichor's silent choir.

With the day’s death, a fervid spark is struck,
cradled in twilight’s dusky cradle.
Zephyr’s fingers, in nightly rites, pluck
embers from the black, where star-hearts sable.

Love—sculptor of shadows in the loam,
as sentries of oak in solemn conclave stand.
Roots enlace the dark, whilst crowns do roam,
in unvoiced oaths of the land.
