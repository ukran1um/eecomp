In whispers stitched by zephyr's hand,
Our lives—entwined 'neath lunar stand,
Grasp at futures, soft and sly,
In the present’s gaze, we shy
From dancing through the void's caress,
Love casting shadows we address.

Pause briefly on the edge of breath—
Our balance held between two deaths,
As gravity, a gentle thief,
Unchains stars in silent grief.
Night drapes us in black velvet sighs,
Your gaze, a universe defies.

In your eyes, infinity submits a tender query,
Encased within our mortal frame, yet never weary.
We are the murmur, souls entwined,
Echoing the grand design.
Within this tender, veiled prance,
We chance upon chance, sweet chance.
