inwardOut—(whatThreadBinds?)

looms of reverie spun(in quicksilver thought),
shapeshifting shades traced on mind’s tapestry;
ephemera bursts—bloomed, notes adrift in bottled seas—
tick to tock... but never.simple as horologe // locked.

here: a terrain of lush enigmas—
each petal's a breath; a cosmos curled,
                galaxies within a dewdrop spiral.

(between—soul: an ocean; beyond—sea: a soul)
murmuring to tides *(who art thou, truly?
WHO through the soundless S P A C E)?*

perhaps we are(n’t)
      but echoes in infinity's silhouette;
defined by the breadth of a *{singular pulse}*
                       (breathe... and release)

from chaos to cosmos to cosmos in chaos, tango
footfalls unclear, yet
  irrevocably authentic.

*So spins the loom of night-dreamt threads,
a kaleidoscope heart's desire—stitched into existence.
