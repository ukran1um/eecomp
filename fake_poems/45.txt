brittle songs of woven shadows,  
in leafless boughs they pirouette,  
secrets unfurl as whispers huddle,   
in the sigh of the wind's quartet.

dawn bleeds in—a hesitant stain,  
city's skin, in trembling reprieve,  
lingering in the alleys' pulse,  
on the cobblestone tapestry we weave.

the city's heart ticks, hidden deep,  
echoing in marbled paths that wind,  
where triumphs lay, unclaimed, asleep,  
in the cradle of the lost and blind.

no more the seagull's ivory swoop,   
now metal wings carve narrow dreams,  
sky—a taut, embroidered loop,  
holds the seamstress' fraying seams.

in hollow canyons, silence blooms,  
bearing fruit from voiceless looms,  
still, the whisper harbors screams,  
etching enigmas in misty streams.

cosmos whirl in porcelain rounds,  
stirring—muses mix the dusk,  
drink from the chalice, sky's soft flush,  
the hush of worlds in transit bounds.
