leaf-whisperers
at midday hush, silk-spinners
of the emerald blush, they swayed in
                       -the gentle touch-
            of wind's sigh, cradled by roots,
            whose depths vye
with Atlas' shoulders, bearing sky,

          swirls of petrichor
in faithful spritz, the forest breathes
      and through it, flits,
a flash of fawn, a rustle unseen,
     tapestry in fifty shades of green,
       where sunlight filters, pure
             and clean,

a huddle of blossoms, tight-knit clan,
         cheek-flushed, to bloom
             as best they can,
         in the cradle of chaos, 
         their riotous plot,
     where every petal unfolds
                    as a thought,
             in the quiet theatre
                   of the uncut lot,

  each leaf, each bud, each clinging vine,
           tremors with stories,
               aged like wine,
                    a whisper here,
                 a murmur there,
    the soft unfurling of natureâ€™s care,
         where time reclines
                in an oaken chair.
