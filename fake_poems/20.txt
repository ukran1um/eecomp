Dunes of syntax shift—gentle breeze
              plays with
      pauses, turns
                ANd puNctuAtion's dance

(silences) wrap
                       around whispers;
              they share secrets in the

void of thoughts, marooned betwixt lines of
                                          ambiguity.
Life's pulse—rhythmic(beating)

           a dance of tides
that come & go—marking
                   time's spell in shifting

grains, trickling through life's narrow
                   mitt, arteries filled with
vows, spoken and silent;

as the 

       horizon—a canvas
awaits the dawn's caress to paint
              a fresh day.

Amid silent worlds,
unfolds a symphony of tranquility;
yet seasons sway—(unrehearsed)

discordant.

But—

to an attuned spirit
dwells the ultimate
unity.
