In whispers through the willow trees—  
secrets deep as oceans, fold  
within rustling leaves, cosmos conceals.

No human heart dares intercept  
the tales that star-crossed lovers wept,  
nor wind repeats what was whispered soft;  
beneath the willow, where shadows crept.

For in this grove, hallowed, hidden,  
nightingale serenades the rose,  
Luna's light shyly bestows  
a silver blanket, those below.

There, ballet fireflies compose—  
luminescent scripts; time slows.  
Universe on parchment—prose  
inked in iridescence, gently glows.
