Chiaroscuro whims—silhouettes, dance
(twilight's play, a dimmer stance),
Reflection-day's laughter, sound's collapse,
an echo, faint in nightly wraps.

Crescent-glow, watchful eyes of night,
Secrets—tender, stir, take flight.
Roots of thought yester-unplucked
Silence's soil, secrets tucked.

Whispers-verdant through cracks, seep,
a symphony-green-black, syncopate sleep.
Time's march, relentless—fades,
Serenade-of-shade invades.

Clasp—eternity, a hand—sands fleeting,
to stars, no glance—earth's pulse, heartbeating.
Death's repose (birth anew),    
a cycle, known by but a few.

Night-spun-affair, a truth unclad,
Life's shadowed might—a dance? how sad...
yet, amid this twirl, without light,
a tender, poignant, relentless fight.
