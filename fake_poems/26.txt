Gossamer's dawn veils the sleeping field,
light's fine fingers weave through drops of dew,

- Whispered symphony morning yields
Paints fresh the scenes for just us two. -

Deep as earth's own heart, aged tale unfolds,
Plucked from fireâ€™s harsh, grasping theft,

Its booming echo over silent shores extolled,
Where land meets sea, and old promises are kept.

Shadows play a chiaroscuro dance,
Twisting in spirals upon the papered stage -

Life's art, crafted by happenstance,
Its timelessness contained within this age.

Bronze leaves murmur secrets to the day,
As sinews sing and ravens lead the way.

Beneath moon's shy, veiled gaze,
Shadows flit in silent parade,

A quiet waltz at the night's soft edge,
A dance of faiths, finely arrayed.

Stars echo in the frosty night,
A tapestry woven in the void's own light.
