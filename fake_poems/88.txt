Rootprints in yestermud,
Unfallen sky-tears hold secrets
in their temporize curl.
Crippled branches cradle voids,
where once laughter hung,
ripe cadences ready for the pluck.

Post-blossom, all but memories
of the weight they bore—
a gravity of innocence.
Seeds, dormant with potential, nest
in earth’s hush, swaddled by leaf-flesh,
sepulchral won from sun’s wide yawn.

The air—a parchment crisp with musk,
carries whispers of would-be kisses,
lost to time’s jealous archive.
And the sun—blind painter, daubing
shadows with regret,
summons dusks to dress wounds in gold.

Harmonics spun from the zephyr’s loom,
weave ballads only solitude can hum.
Here, the past—a guest, unobtrusive,
clinks its glass to present’s steady gaze.
Orchard’s secret ripens,
Speaks in tongues of root and bough.
