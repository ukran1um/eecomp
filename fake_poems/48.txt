Whispers ripple through the cosmos’ weave,
A vagrant thought untethered, not to cleave
To star nor system, dances through the eave
Of space-time undereave.

Babylonian echoes, spectral gloom,
Once sipping darkened milk, now consumed
In Temporal clutches—still, none presumed
To dance within its womb.

From depths a resonant chime, ancient rouse,
Rising the timeless to a starlit prowl,
Not storm, nor thunder’s call—just the meanwhile
Of stars in question's bow.

A feather, a dot, a firmament's inside,
Adrift on tides where eternity bides,
Across folded dimensions, existence rides—
Where dream and day collide.
