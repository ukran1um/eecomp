A timeline fractures-deliquesce
(((ripples echo))) through crystal-lens prism—
blink & it shIftS—
a voyage's vignette:

titans escape in geothermal dreams
—below—it simmers—a tenebrous sphere—
whilst, above, Selene sketches an incomplete sonnet
(in umbral strokes over indigo drapery)

sepia-tinged annals unfurl in foliology,
each folio a chronicle, a cipher in cellulose—
((deciduous whispers))(dance)(upon)(the)(breeze),
text-ing themselves as they descend into senescence

flotsam tales (((ajar)))
in a chest of mAhOgAnY dreams—
’sails billow—threading Poseidon's fabric,'\n
neptune's loom—where mariners’ echoes resonate

Clock-spindle—fandango—a waltz out of sync
Time's tune, syncopated, a vinyl's valiant spin—
resonates—anachronistic—anomaly,
a fleeting pirouette in entropy's embrace

In ’twixt shadows & shine—a cavalcade breaks the even-tide,
w a l t z i n g with that briefest fracture—
—gilt-edged leaves sashay—alighting upon aubade ground—
casting their lot with the elegy of diluvian hours—splayed

This fabric—the loomspace of Existence—
PULSES with the cadence of EMPIRES;
stitch 'pon stitch in infinite regress—
the loomed expanse of rebirth & recess.
