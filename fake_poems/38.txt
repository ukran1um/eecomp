**Silhouettes whisper tides**,    
Inside my cupped palms —    
Gossamer dreams, light as air, beings without face,    
(they sidle through the fabric of time)
dancing upon yesterday's breaths   
...and tomorrow's quiet yearnings.

Breaths, woven with the zephyr's hush,    
(a tapestry unspun)
pierce the clamor of the common day,    
while I — quiet forger of moments —    
sculpt shadows into deep-rooted oaks,    
beneath a waxen moon's silent gaze.

Spaces between stars, inky depths—    
I reach within, fingers caress the velvet night,    
searching for that *—swallowed by cosmos—*   
where silence wraps around me tighter than warmth,
a galaxy's heartbeat    
synced to my own unsteady rhythm.

Here, on the edge of the palpable,    
I waltz with the void,    
each motion a chapter in life's vast narrative,    
each pulse a moment in the dance of time,    
orchestrating a symphony—    
(you may not see it unfurl)    
yet oh, it resonates...    

*unrestrained*

*unmatched*

**undiminished**
