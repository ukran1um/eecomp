silver&tide—moondance whispers,
spilt:upon cobble, myth&mists
     each stone—secrets,kissed
(lovers, lost)to time’s insistence

grey—
            dawn, yet (hope) insists
in sheets(tangled)of dreaming(twisted)

vinegrown towers,
                   forgotten yester
where bards' laughter( echoes, bell)
walls now hold—the storied dwell
time’s fingers—soft, cannot pester,
ivy climbs—her tales:
                                            to tell

grove midst oaks—oh they conspire,
leaves:each a whispered sonnet,
nature’s pulse—a quiet quire
throbbing beneath (skin’s fire)
roots entwine—earth’s attire,
yearning: for sun’s: lost pyre

autumn’s touch(feathers' hand)
(her palette)—rustic sorcery
paints the world—copper reverie
a tapestry: o’er the land
beneath twilight’s canopy
 World softens(insongs) to (stand)

in Heart's still—(unyielding chambers)
secrets, love: concealed
glances skyward—silently peel
through ether, tender: feelings reach—
without a reveal,
truths untold—but(ever) nearing
