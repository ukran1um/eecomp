Dusk-weaves intertwine:

hush-laden thyme ticks silent,
petal-clock hearts fall—adore?

Harvest-souls gust, tryst tales in tempest-looms,
h e m l o c k dances punctuate—
the ebbing tide (a silhouette of driftwood dreams?)
embroiders shadows, mast:mast, memory:memory.

Caress of palest moon, finger by dew-finger,
entwined in morning's quiet breath—
(oh, love's clenched mist?)

Wrap me, night’s soft musk,
within your dusk.
Cradle me,
   where shadows kiss the glen—in fate's might-have woven-been.
