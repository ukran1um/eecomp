Wind whispers (through) the 
weeping willow weeping—not its sorrows loaned  
—borrowed hearts heavy beneath—

Leaves shudder-tear drops laden with untold tales
secrets whispered to the roots … diving deep, deep, 
deep_dark.

Sky weeps—a wound, bruised purples, mourning oranges,
bleeds into horizons as day fears night’s claim.

Sparrow flutters—frenzied heart_beat_drum
a solo dance on the soon_dark_stage.

Below willow weeps
a form clasps at nothingness—
(the void clasping back—a hollow embrace).

This—
the ballad (unspoken)
the aria (of the ground)
humming through root_marrow
as the willow sways
gracefully—forlorn.
