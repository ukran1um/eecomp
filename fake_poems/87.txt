In her grasp—an instant’s monarch reigns,
(velvet night’s embrace, stars whisper—names).

Thyme’s breath, through sashes open, steals,
Grief’s tender throb—time’s transient heels.

Dust dances in the quiet heart, a tale
Of change, where shadows and dreams prevail.

Silent stories told without gold’s glitter,
Love flickers, quiet as a night’s soft twitter.
