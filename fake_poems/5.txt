Scattered selves,
a dandelion in the clasp of zephyrs,
yielding to capricious breaths of change.

Thoughts needle through fabric of day,
barefoot on dew-soaked grass
adrift (whimsy’s wayward kin)
in azure's tender clasp.

Moments unfurl, as petals in sun’s coaxing arms,
a beguilement as intimate as midnight murmurs
coaxing words to pirouette —
a hush of e x p a n s i o n.

B r e a t h e me (to essence),
thrum of pulse, skin to sinew:
a symphony of heartstrings
spun from ∞ cosmos ∞ dust.

In each beat, resonance

s weave Being onto canvas of Now,
tracing life’s raw seams
where horizon dreams on ocean's edge, 
and eternity leaps into the tangible grasp.

Breath of innocence, once anchored,
now a burst of wild dance,
echo of a primordial cadence
held in the tender grip of existence.
