splintered azure—
fabric tears as day unfurls
a painter-dipped palette, skies bleed
into the edges of crinkled leaves
(utterances in decay)
script-scrawled earth veins pulse beneath. 

eve, the subtlest robber, tiptoes in
siphons color, trades in shades,
-shadows sketch fleeting tales-
while the horizons sigh into oblivion,
rest against the crook of crescent calm,
a siren’s lullaby, night whispers' balm.

among astral lace, fates entwine—
in stellar whispers, tales unwind.
time traverses the spun web
galactic murmurs, a needle’s thread
all history, a pinpoint’s breadth.

yet—within your universe-locked gaze,
pulses a dawn of uncharted nebulas,
here—in this glance, eternities pause,
and I am, unendingly, irrevocably
yours—a cosmos forged in orbs.
