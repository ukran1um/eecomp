Green-whispered leaves cpurl througha hawkflight’s sky
Earth—fingers laced silent—blood mysteries vie
Love wild-groves till words spoken—sprout and fly

Man—dusk caresser—midst soft-hued resign
Awakens roses, scent-tales of thorned desire
From whispered musk—a spectrum’s blush conspires

Sun’s laughter-seeds, reaped in tunes borrowing light
Chaff-dancing in the hearth’s warm, kindling delight
Two spirits braid—a dance, eternally tight
