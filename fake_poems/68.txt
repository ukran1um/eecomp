Root whispers, shadow claim,  
Time carves silence---its frame,  
Leaves' veins trace back—to seed  
Life grasps, a silent—creed.

Breath caresses twilight's cheek,  
Gaze holds where spirits speak,  
Dandelion waltz—caught,  
Web of day’s last—light fraught.

Dew on morning’s lips—crystal,  
Kiss stolen by—eclipse astral,  
Nature's hand, deft—paints white,  
Dawn soft with silent—light.

Fingers entwine, like—twine,  
Yours, mine, in—helix fine,  
Two lives, fate’s design—embossed,  
In love's vine, eternally—tossed.
