In a realm—dwindlest,  

sweetened throe, tattered lace,  
~~two hearts~~
*entwin'd*.

Jest of years, spirited plea,  
A tapestry wrought—
(not of silk—a shared reverie.)

Ripples and waves^shared^path^unfolds  
Not linear—**tracings**—or tales *anciently told,*  
But pulses of crimson, murmurations *diverse*,  
Each beat of **the heart**—a universe.

Amidst zephyrs'—whispered lore  
Where nectar'd **promises do implore,**  
(2 souls alight verm!lion flame)  
In cleave to
s c r i b e
an undying name
On the parchment of time, the infinite expanse.

He: chisel yore, crisp edges—and stance,  
She: gossamer veil, mist-laden dance;  
Ser
e
nade
of epochs—their echoes r o m a n c e.

With dawn's gentle pry,  
Fingers of light—skirt the sky,  
Are their longings \cast/, fervently sown—  
In the furrows of eternity, love's seeds ***thrown.***
