brittled leaves navigate—ship's heart,
through earth's parched tongues whisper—depart,
while roots, recount our depths, unseen,
within the chest of boughs, they lean,
sparrows weave hymns—a legacy,
whispers birthed from the sylvan sea.

Canvas skies capture moments’ flight,
where cicadas don twilight's might,
in softened song, the dark replies,
while the moon, in her cradle—lies,
caressing the fold of night's blush,
in quiet dance, the heavens hush.

Celestials jest in silent arcs,
threading the waltz of starry sparks,
as my compass, with its needle's eye,
weaves dreams from iron, under sky,
a riverbed's breath—a gentle rush,
my history fades at twilight's hush.
