beneath silent boughs of hazel  
midsummer scribed its prose  
across time's unraveling shawl  
blended in serene honey-flow    
our whispers took root in earth's embrace  
breaths painted in aurous waves  
echoes bloomedâ€”petals fluted  
over Elysium's awakening gaze    
we traced gentle arcs through years  
fingertips dancing aflame  
in the waltz of igneous spheres  
spelling the tender lexicon of desire    
joy, a flickering strand  
sways at night's cool fringe  
yet in constellations love has named  
our light is etched upon the infinite
