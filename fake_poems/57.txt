In twilight's cradle, oaken leaves
kissGentleCheeks of eve—
whispersLinger; secrets: conceive
(in)TimelessDance they weave

CoursingRivers—silken thread
We (but vessels) fate'sGreatLoom,
StoriesSpun, softestBed
Beneath—watchfulEyeOfMoon

Amidst still a lone deer treads
Through hushedGlades dreamingMeadows,
NatureHomage—life’sTapestry spreads
Sewn withJoys fringedShadows

Guardians ancientRhyme
Realm whereOwls keepScore,
Our lives butWhispers inThyme
AsStars recount theLore

ThusBound, myHeart, nature'sThrall
(the pulseOfWorld) inSync withMine
Her symphony(AwhisperedCall)
InEveryLeaf: divine’sDesign.
