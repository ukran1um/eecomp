cosmos—veins pulse silence (whispers tread)
stardust? mingles with the soil’s embrace.

[quantum sea, playful light—
currents unseen, flow, and sway]

night's clasp + day's kiss converge here:
silent (hum) where dreams might('ve) lain.
cosmic waltz (an array):
stardust gowns & galaxies in disarray.

atoms dance—fate’s quiet tune.
time contemplates (a patient wait).
invisible thrum; tapestry spun,
Nature: her ceaseless re-creation.

nebula’s chord, boldly cast—
universe’s tale, vast & untold.
ballet grand, void cradled:
every spin, swells the old.

quark's leap (photon races)
all in cosmic—embrace.
spheres’ symphony, boundless, profound,
each grain of wonder—intimately found.
