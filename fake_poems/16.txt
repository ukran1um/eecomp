A shadow dance(neath the)
whisperedumbrageof
ancienttrees,

a lattice 
work 
of – sound(silence) bro ken

by the soft humblink of a
fire(fly’s beacon)— we find
(solitude's caress, a tender)
insistenceswept 
            in the wind’s 
             soft 
                 cradle.

The touch of twilight(kisses)the earth’s cheek,
tasting day’s remini scent savoring
a lonesome (sigh in thequietude)of night's embrace.

Starsflicker (in your eyes and mine) an intimacy,
that even the sky’s 
             vast
          canvass could not (contain within its infinite
                                         expanse)
and the moon,
a distant(lover's heart),
pulses with luminescent yearning.
