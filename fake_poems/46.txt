Dusk—whispers (to the waning light)
"Stay...a bit? Longer," 
for shadows(yet to learn)(
the(ire) dance.)
Leaves listen(rustle)anticipated
sorrow—as if tomorrow's sun
were just—a—rumor
spread by the hopeful—cries
of dawn's own sparrow(.)

Silhouetted_forms atop(stoic stones,)
grasp—at passing(time)—
edges soft(against)
the tactile sky...
Ancient voices__echo—through__modern—lines,
quiet(defiance)of(the)ever-spinning(rhyme.)

Amidst_this_scene; fervent seed(sprout),
thought unbound(broad as) [the sycamore's shout].
Not clad in arms(nor armored)(in) brittle—iron of doubt,
but draped(silk spun) from dreams(night has wrought).

Verily,( )chalice_overflows_with nectar(not-been-told),
story(whispered) beneath burgeoning(moon's fold).
Sip_of_it—witness alchemy(of old,)
transforming, transmuting_into(tomorrow's) gold.

Yet—caveat—to siren(song)sweet beguiles:
bewary of the_quiet(follows) the storm.
Beasts_prowl where grass grows wild;
where mind_wanders, (the heart)(is torn.)

Stars, (once aloof,) now_descend to_inquire,
embracing(earth with cold, ancient_fire).
And_dusk, it retreats(conceding to night)
leaving shadows to_waltz, devoid(of light.)
