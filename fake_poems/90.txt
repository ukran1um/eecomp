Amberglow tomorrow,
---pulled taut
by yesterday’s bowstrings.
Whispers gestate in tendrilled thrums—
pomegranate seeds burst; wisdom springs.

Leafpage lifetome unfurls
– within;
between lines, essence of worlds.
Tethered by inhaling tide rhythms,
opus moments horizon shreds.

Lover’s lament,
feathertouch skintoskin,
epoch in a grin’s curve, captured.
Heart yarn – the spindle and the spun –
threads dancing ‘til evening’s shorn.

Breaths of dew, where night meets the morn,
silence cathedrals, in reverence born.
Forests breathe secrets in green whispers sung,
as roots myth-entangle – nature’s thrones among.
