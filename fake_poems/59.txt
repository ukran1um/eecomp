moonchild's cradle—
    earth's tender clutch,
          lineage secrets in her
             soiled palm whispers,

    lunar in eyes, the dew's
       repose and the sigh of 
          unspent yesterdays,

            scarlet threads, a vow's
               delicate weave pulling at
                  the quiet hem of twilight,

    steadfast, old oak roots lace—
          heart's echo in thine thrum,
             in the silent watch of sempiternal boughs
