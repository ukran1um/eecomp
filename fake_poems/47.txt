In the hush-hush blush of eventide's kiss,  
colors converge in a wistful abyss.  
A vault so grand, stretching timeless expanse,  
cradles dusk's children, both chance and dance.

Timeworn whispers twist through the fickle breeze,  
bearing secrets sealed by the Pleiades.  
The moon, an orb-weaver, elegant, poised,  
silhouettes quiet in the dark’s soft noise.

Within this fold where Umbras waltz with light,  
sprouts a stillness from the loom of night.  
Each sigh spills mysteries, moments unfurled,  
spiraling softly to the edge of the world.

In life’s quiet crochet, fate plies its lace,  
through star-stitched seams, the cosmos finds its place.  
The heart beat hushes, veiled in velvet pale,  
listens, as infinity spins its yarned tale.
