whis-pers fracture silence,
crescen.do: of hushed! defiance
(the night's embrace)—a shell, cracked,
ink from countenance—celestial, blacked.

verdant (whispers) yearn, urging bloom,
light skims room's edge—a quiet, costume
of leaves and earth, speak in soliloquy
yearning—tranquil rebirth's liturgy.

indelible, the marks (wrought),
canvas courted, thoughts—are sought,
rooted veins entwine with soil,
(as) love plays spoils—effort, toil.

marrow's subdued echoes, kept
to sparrow tunes unseen, adept
nature's fable beats a note,
star serenade, in astral—tote.

wind's soft sigh, a dervish whirls,
with leaves it dances, dips and twirls
to court affectations of trees,
aloof in thought, (they) foster these:

legacies, braided—symbols, entwined
by time's sea—sculpted, designed.
in tender cradle, moment's set:
humanity, nature's ladle—silhouette.

essence braided (with simply,to be)
in the unseen lines—(our eyes, they flee)
hearts roam, beyond sight's claim
whispers guide us—homeward (flame).
