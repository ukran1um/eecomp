In verdant still where dreams unfold their maze,
a daffodil, alone, caresses wounds aglow.
May’s breath, a secret murmur through the haze,
roots weave within the dark—a silent fete below.

Thief crimson, stealing daylight’s final blaze,
casts quivering shadows binding with gentle throes.
Yet under a canopy of stars, astray,
love entwines the hours in tender, fleeting throws.

Two souls in whispered waltz, they gently graze,
stitching warmth within cold’s encroaching close.
Eyes lock, the cosmos shrinks to an ember’s craze,
in this exchange—a pivot where all truth flows.

Gesture speaks where words eclipse,
a hush where essence finds its eclipse.
