whisper-lull(a dim)light and shadow
play upon thoughts(eclipsed by quiet)—

consider this:
the dance of a leaf carried by breath,
adrift upon the silent
stream of consciousness—

in [out]—breathing, the pulse of life beats,
a simple journey through vastness?

Echo(e)s, unwritten, resound across the abyss,
the quiet ballet of cosmic bodies adrift,
where metaphors unfurl.

little(being), cloaked in stardust's veil,
you paint (with light) secluded alcoves
of (heart's) tender expanse.

Golden-flecks, Porcelain-shards,
we are the dance—canvas and vein,
an electric hum of narrative not yet spoken.

Weave, oh weaver of fate's loom—
words that pirouette in void's embrace,
challenge the calm—bring shape to
the dreamscape of silence's shroud —

to cradle the nascent light of tomorrow’s promise.
