day's final breath—  
a tapestry  
of dying hues,  
whispering leaves—  
secrets—

etched in bark,  
life's cruel passage,  
the silent march of years  
entangled roots weave  
stories from old scars

we mirror this:  
skin-papered stories etched,  
souls in woodgrain fused;  
leaves cradle tales unfurled,  
nature's slow-voiced bards  

branches—sorrow-laden dancers—  
yield waltzes to the wind  
leaves fall—soft  
as unwept tears—  
in stillness, adjunct solace
