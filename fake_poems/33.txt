In the canvas-dome of evermore,
a silhouette pirouettes, scores
the air with trails of scarlet flight,
a timekeeper’s graceful indict.

She flits through the clutch of bygone years,
carving echoes where once were fears;
in ether inscribes, a music to heed,
as ages beneath her, heedlessly bleed.

‘Pon velvet pall, lies watchful the Sphinx,
gilded gaze slicing through temporal brinks,
enigmatic guardian to history's choir,
its silent hum, an undying fire.

In warp and weft of fate's firm loom,
we're woven in, through warp of bloom,
fraying the edges of fabric's rhyme,
defying the weaver's ancient chime.

Behold, the steadfast olive, aged yet revered,
its gnarled roots time's secrets seared,
in its shade, truths are softly spoken,
of lives interlaced, and destinies awoken.

Beneath the vast eternal's hue,
cradled by dawn's incipient dew,
we script our nows, cleanse our past,
clutch at daybreak’s promises, vast.
