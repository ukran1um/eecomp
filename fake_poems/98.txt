Tramlines vein the cobble's skin,
Jingle-jangle beggars spin,
Old soles tap an echoed tune,
Merriment beneath the moon.

Shadow plays on bricks in bloom,
Twirl and tickle, night's costume,
Alleyway's canorous breaths,
Day spills secrets, night bequeaths.

Lovers trace the dawn's soft cheek,
Whispers weave through silence, speak
Of a canvas stretched and bared,
A new world dreamt, dared, declared.

The oaken heart whispers deep,
Stories spiral, climb and creep,
Ancient voices carve the grain,
Wisdom's script, nature's refrain.

Rose unfolds in wild entwine,
Where ardor meets the serpentine,
Petal and blood, stark contrast,
In thorn's embrace, beauty's cast.

Words but air and ink confined,
Into being, briskly signedâ€”
In a verse, a world's brink skirts,
Pouring deeper than mere spurts.
