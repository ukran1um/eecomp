A dandelion wishes not—but
to dance upon the errant—gust,
its solemn seeds like whispered—trust,
scatter—where the earth is—cut.

Within the heart where secrets—dwell,
and time's soft footprints fade to—lore,
lies love—a ceaseless, swellin'—shore—
that lingers long, for—evermore.

Leaves' gentle fall, a tender—sight,
brushes past the oak’s bold—stance,
whispering through the air’s—romance,
forming life's eternal—dance.

Yet 'tis the sun’s resplendent—plea,
upon the dawn of sorrow's—end,
that paints the sky, allows to—mend,
the souls it kisses, pure—unbend.

Hence, in nature's grasp, we—find,
the threads of life, so finely—spun,
under stars, and moon, and—sun,
until our earthly days are—done.
