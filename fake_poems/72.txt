Vines embrace the weathered brick,
Whispers, wishes blend to thick
A facade, marbled past, stands mute,
Guardian of secrets, in its root.

In the meadow, dreams entwine,
Children's echoes lost in time;
Solemn cloak upon the green,
Earth's breath cradled, unseen.

Willow weeps, her mourning veil
Sweeps the dusk, a silent tale;
Yore's whispers beneath her wait,
Fading ink, to be read by fate.

Time, that warden, splits and cracks
Cobblestones laid in lovers' tracks;
Their sonnets drift, longing to be heard,
Vows etched in night, every tender word.

Heartbeat strums existence's chord,
Crickets' symphony, ardent and adored;
Canvas sky with starry blooms,
Ode to eternity, our dance consumed.

Crown of daisies on the river's crest,
Dancing valley twirl, no rest;
Life kissed into stone and reed,
Our essence weaves, fleeting, indeed.
