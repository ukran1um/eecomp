Through veiled mists—history whispers
adrift in seas, forgotten lore.
Time tender; yields, crimson—kiss
twin suns on horizons, yesteryears' sorrow.

Rippling gardens, hearts in tales
unfurl—gaze: moon's silent sermon,
brushes dream canopies, painting silvered
twilight's canvas, slumbering pulse.

The willow weeps, joyous agony
wisdom—an elegy.
Symphony, natural order, notes promised
carved existence—perennial scribed ballad.

Lovers' glance, embrace fleeting—a waltz
time's corridor, steps to heartbeat,
universe dance, outlasts stars
echoes of— infinite.

Intimacy's analog, narrative's refrain
witness—opus ancestry, testaments
steeped in kindred spirit heritage,
expanse—oceans wide, being deep.

The Artisan of Existence crafts—
orchards boundless, seeds passing instant,
moments—an orchard, ripe with evernow
awaiting the harvest, souls—passion's perennial bloom.
