whispers graze the hurricane's ear—a gentle plea,
velvet strokes over cliffs hard wrought by time's decree,
within the core
   (absent whole) 
           hearts beat 
           in irregular rhymes.
—yet a world fast in chains, endures its sorrowful twirls,
     dawn exhales dusk,
     dusk consumes day.

stone-carved chronicles, the pure and the stained,
flesh yearns beneath celestial apathy reigned,
in quivering light, silhouettes—the artist unknown—
   define (im)mortality by the cries they own.
     
      i(n gardens bartered with salt for soil,
      echoes sprout—barren harvests toil,
      famished yet fed, we never desist)

we, dust specks spiraled in cosmic disorder,
questions suspended like weighty anchors—
      who smiths the chains?
      who wears?
      who breaks?
      
   might iron recall its slumbering stone,
   might stone retreat to its stelliferous throne,
   might stars wander—light to night's nest
   a cycle (—but never silent rest).

whispers cradling equipoise
                        —an illusion of poised—
screams sculpt the weights
     teetering fates
                                   whisper to scream, exhale each breath.
