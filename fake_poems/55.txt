In the haven where shadows share secrets,
silken dusk lays a caress,
Dreams, loom-woven, wrap 'round
olden oaks in tranquil undress.

A robin, dusk's artisan,
notes spun on evening's weave,
Bridges built in tender sounds,
where life and mortality cleave.

Stones aged, entwined with lore;
under tumultuous charcoal art,
They scribe, in lichen script,
the silent chronicles of the heart.

'Neath evening's cloak, a dance:
secrets pirouetting with flair,
Thistle, bold in resilience—
solitary, unyielding, rare.

A tapestry, nature’s own,
green yarn interlaced with bloom,
Bearing strength's silent hymn,
where fate's threads spell and unspool.

Tales owned by ivory sails,
secrets hushed in sea-foam laughter,
Storm-chasers, tide-riders,
in their wake—tranquility sought after.

Sorrow concealed in brine's bellow,
joy embedded in crested waves,
Depth's hush, an abyss cradled,
in peaceful, undercurrent graves.

Wind's brine-kiss stirs the gulls,
scribing sky with winged decree,
They hum of transient perching,
on cliffs, sun-daubed and free.

Where land's embrace meets water's kiss,
flickers of primal desire ignite,
Waves comb to spirits unkempt:
a raw symphony, ever infinite.
