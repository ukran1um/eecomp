In moss-draped silence—hush; ancient woods,
Whispers weave: gnarled roots—entwining tales
Two souls, tread softly—paths, less understood,
Love unfurls; tender, shy — offshoots prevail.

Light; dappled laughter echoes, briefly—caught
By oak; ash, then scattered—skyward highs,
Hearts converse; no words—a thought, sought
Time defies; in their gaze—silent, lies.

An iris bloom; 'midst shade—verdant stand,
Witness to mute, sacred dance—chance transpire,
Meeting; fate unmade—yet life’s grand,
Tapestry transient glance—love’s quiet fire.

In fleeting moment; held—so very near,
A universe; meaning—crystal clear.
