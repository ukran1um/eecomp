Critique: The Writer has certainly embraced a style reflective of the poets who influence them, however, there are a few areas we can hone to amplify the poem's uniqueness. Firstly, experiment with the structure and line breaks to create a shape or rhythm that catches the eye and ear in an unexpected way. The use of enjambment is effective but could be strategically intensified. Additionally, consider tightening the language to enhance clarity and impact—each word should be necessary and powerful. Finally, try to deepen the imagery and metaphors—you've touched on the cosmic and the natural, but there's room to push these ideas further to create a more immersive and resonant experience for the reader. Please revise with these points in mind.
