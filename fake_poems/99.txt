recently birthed from chaos,
a cosmos in the confines of your gaze
unbounded by the banal; so boisterously beautiful
within the whispers and the wistful winds

you - an entity, encapsulated entirety
of tempests tranquil, of silent storms
a garden untamed; wildflowers within
soil rooted in soul, in sinew and skin

collision, a vivid vignette of vitality
carved not in stone but writ in the winds
a love, not of letters
but in beats, in breaths unbidden

such is the crafting of constellations
in the cursive of our creation
a narrative nestled in the knowing
a tale told in the touching, the tender turmoil

your eyes, not just windows but worlds
reflect such stories untold
the ember, ever-dancing in the daylight
finding form in the flicker, the fabric of the forlorn

Yet shall we dance, my dear?
in the twilight of times forgotten
forever folding into the fables we've found
fashioned in the folds of a love unfurled
