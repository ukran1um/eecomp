In orchard's heart—beneath dapple sway,
(Where light, shadow, play; ancient game)
Boughs conspire—whisper: nature's name.
Tranquil dance, apple blossoms lay.

Cradled spring's embrace—petals unfurl,
Softness newborn day,
orchard's oath: as blooms decay,
Summer fruit—pearled.

Breath, sighs; rustling leaves conspire,
Whispered lore: root, rain, sun.
Tale spun deep: earth heavens run,
Composing life—fertile loam's attire.

In this dell—bloom, tender shoot;
Echo ancient flute.
Zephyrs’ song, twisted branches mute,
Orchard dreams: fruit, blossom's loot.
