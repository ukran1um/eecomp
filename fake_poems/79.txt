beneath Luna’s gaze, we, still,
intertwine—essence spilt
murmurs dressed in night, exchanged:
souls adrift, hearts uncaged.

shadow dance; with silent creed,
life, the sea—our plea, freed
time's embrace—a lock, aglow,
perennial love's shadow flow.

rose whispers, quiet might,
endings beget dawn's light
fallen petals, stories sown,
an undying flame, alone.
