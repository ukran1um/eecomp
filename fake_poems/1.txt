In dawn's gentle split – a silent morn,    
Widows trace memories, with fingers worn.    
Violets quake in the subtlest greys,    
Ethereal whispers of the lost brigade.    

Time trickles, muted as whispered snow,    
Empires burgeon in lambent afterglow,    
Breathe – fog on the silvered looking-glass,    
Dimming, but their echoes touch, amass.    

Etched deep within the marrow—earth's curve,    
Poets distill life's quintessence, verve.    
Immerse in the void where stardust twirls,    
Scribing history's dance, in infinite whirls.    

*life's choreography, in murmured plays,*    
In twilight's script – till the light decays.    
Fingers marred by ink’s lasting claim,    
Carving out a whisper, a solitary name.
