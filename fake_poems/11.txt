Whor(l)ds~of ...time(the spiral dance),
time/strung & chance~~cha(cha)nce interlaced,
Echo(e)s [not of sole/soul but THOUGHT]
  reverBerat'e in Time's crafted chalice.

  ...But...HARK?
In. the - Silence, betwixt beats,
an UnSeen Tempo plays shadows,
on {Plato's cave} walls,
yearn'ng: FreeDOM from photon chains.

Oh sun[ken] sun, 'neath AmberGraIn,
Doth rise? anew, sneaks' vault ov'rhead;
The phoenix loops fiery desire,
An ouroboros, intertwined in perpetual dance.

Icarusâ€”waxen joy now liqUid,
ambitions to sea given forth,
In brine's depth, myths multiply,
Each terminal an (unfolding) narrative.

Under Luna(bright,)'s survey I ink,
As Olde as the marrow of day,
An era's lore synthesized,
Syntax begot in wonder's query.
