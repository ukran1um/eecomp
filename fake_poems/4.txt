Whispers tangled
in th(e) throes of cha(os)

[listen]

hearts are (echo)ing
lifetimes frayed beneath s(kins)

[listen]

th(e)ir (sil)ent plea is a
galaxy spinning recklessly
painting (cha)os â€“ order un

known 

to those with ears un
(tuned)

[listen closely] 

fibrillations of human(i
ty) quiver on a (thr)ead
a muffled ballet in 
the h(e)artbeat of a universe too
vast for simple rhymes

yet -

we dance (in)visible
tethered to the 
s(rings) of existence 

[listen] 

                                                                       and the whispers become (a symphony)
