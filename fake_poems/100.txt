(mind's myriad mountains, madness—vast&sharp
                                                        unbirthed from earth—mind's warring, shadowed hearth)
esche*w rhyme—defer. to meter's mocking laugh
          ---thought rivers cascade beneath logic's graph---

Bent...backwards, wrestling cosmic gales (they stand
                             whisperingSecrets, vestiges—grand
             empires crumbled; silt washed from the hand
thought's topography, micro-time's sand

within—Words wander (dwellers) in dark,
veins non-linear—a whispering spark
                               cast in the skull's hid hollows, neural dark,
rippling the edge of tongue (unheard! embark).

Stumbling, Syllables seek out the light (Breach)
the conscious shell, (they reach) rhythmic-as-speech
Yet unbound, they commune ((As those who teach
without adornment; plainest truths their leech))

Through twisted corridors—Sense awaits,
decorum unearthed by Chaos, Fates
recomposed—debris turned dense (the pate's
tempest-torn soothsayer, still—hesitates).

Here rests poem creature: peculiar, discrete
from the leviathans' famed elite
literature’s bones—this fabric, replete
((a differently woven Nature's feat)).
