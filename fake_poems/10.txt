(withered whispers—)echoing through a chasm of Souls
-where vermillion memories bleed into today’s grey-
these Scars, living, breathing, hidden behind glass screens
      and the vis(ions) of progress
      cloaked in shroud of novelty

the hollow *tink* an(te)bellum of freedoms’ dream
as silence envelops

our neon forests, gr(owing) cold,
uncanny shadows cast by their artificial glow
our (humanity)—an echo enclosed within these metallic woods
           s.tillborn

and in the quiet—fragmented—beyond,
serenades lost amidst a torrent of bytes
our connection(love), too often unspooling.into.oblivion
a tableau——
               no less a requiem
for the(e) tangible (s)paces
where once we danced - coalesced free -

painted(ing) across the canvas of the cosmos,
those gentle strokes of whimsy and serendipity,
solemn whispers from this digital expanse plea:
          “Fleeting children, clasp your moments tight.”
