Afield—dark! Cloverdome undulates, a shadowbreath,
    Hover-lark, wordless (sings) transfer;
Brook—whispers weave & wind, through namelorn stones,
    a Ripples' dance, endless—beyond tame.

Twilight, dusk's artisan—pends canvas 
Night—,
    A timid hush descends; a crimson blush subdues  
    (day yields—quietus acceptance).

    —Moon: coy, glances sidelong, with argent cortège, 
Chases Sun's gilded retreat—
    Ascends, silent sovereign; commands the vespertine.

    [Slumberworld below], oblivious to celestial ballet above; 
Night’s harbored truths, whisperlost, within dream-spun threads.

    A sphere unleashed! where verity alights, hearts (unweighed) respire.
    Stardust cores amidst], night's conundrum [whispered breaths
craft cosmos' gentle weave—mystery unspun.
