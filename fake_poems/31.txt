in twilight's hush—a whisper, a fracture, a crevice
through arched boughs, its secrets—spoke
the murmurs (oh the murmurs) of a twisted oak

symphony in_leafy shroud
roots (those roots) dug DEEP, its head
Unbowed—by time's strict Hand it wasn't (was.not) cowed

each knot a story, barkwrit tales
of stormnight bitegales, & in each SCAR, life's crux prevails;

for in the heart of_twisted wood,
beauty
          ofage
                      is
           understood—(a testament)
to Time—withstood

beside it: flows a silent_stream,
Reflecting dusk's ^last^ dying gleam—
a narrative {in tender dream}

beneath THE OAK A shadow lies,
its FORM ^^not bound by earth nor skies,
A part of all it [decries]

'neath starlight's everwatchful; eyes
this resting {place} of a heart.that.sighs,
A tale of life that never≠dies

so whisper_on, (you twisted oak)
within your ArMs, all life's invoke—
the truth in growth, the strength_In_broke.
