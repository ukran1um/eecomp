Before the birth of day's first gale,
a huddled whisper weaves through chaos' veil,
sewing the seams of silence without fail.

Rivers mural themselves along corridor walls,
mountains hoard tales that time enthralls,
canyons' breath—fable's call—reverberates and falls.

In woe's embrace with rapture spun,
the fabric of being, of life, undone.
Yet, hushed repose speaks volumes none
decoded by the lust of sun.

Feathers of lead light up the quill,
sketching dreams unfettered, still.
An opus—lone, unbridled trill,
beyond the grip of corporeal thrill.

Thunder now clasps the waltz of a relentless tryst,
Nature's ingénue, a silhouette kissed.
Chaos, now donned in serenity's mist,
orchestrates the dance of the existentialist.
