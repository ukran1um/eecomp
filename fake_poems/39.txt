Velvet shadows cast, cobalt thoughts at dusk,
A murm'ration—mem'ries—flock in twilight's must;
Brass sun's echo fades, whispers in bloom,
Hush'd spectrum cradles day's impending gloom.

Embers—passion's end—on ashes' dance,
Time-veiled sonnet in the labyrinth's trance;
Indigo silence shelters treasures unseen,
Dreams capsize, the mariner to celestial queen.

Alabaster ink, arcane script in mind's cave,
Verse vestiges woven on reverie's wave;
From loom of daydreams, spun yarns align,
Forgotten yearnings, solace—forever entwine.

Rhythms break, disrupt—
form's flow disjoints.
In void's embrace, our narrative anoints;
Raw emotion's cut—precise, unfurls,
Distilled to burden—essence of feeling swirls.
