In whispers’ silhouette, echo_(e_c_h_o) through
empty veins of a cityscape asleep, while
steel(ivy)climbs, unforgiving, over slumbers soft
and neon—pulses—a tourniquet for stars that
once blinked (stories) in morse, a language lost...

Yet within these serrated shadows, and rhythmic reaching
of hearts(automata)thrumming, there blooms:

A pause(`whisper of green`) amid the echoing unsettle,_(a)
singular (living)breathing, petal amidst the iron and echo,
Cosmically forgotten maybe, yet somehow felt—deeply rooted,
a small defiant beat against the cold cadence of `night`.
