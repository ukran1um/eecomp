th(r)eads of being(s) tangle in knots of existence—
bare, soft cotton scraps from (yester)years’ gowns,
(we)ave(d) through the looms of dreams and quiet despair,
frayed e(d)ges of hope firmly grasp(e)d and sli(p)p(er)y

shadow(D)ance in the pale-moon(shine)
a ballet of doubts, a (whis)pered lore,
dusk’s breath hold(ing) tight its fleeting (grace),

Murmur(ed) waves—a s(e)a of memory’s (gleam)
soft(er) strokes tracing lines on life’s wrinkled (palm),
ancient ech(o)es, whispers of a time-worn tale
f(ad)ing (yet) glimmer(ing), v(ibr)ant in the twilight (silence),

o(r)d(er) em(e)rges; a dance—delicate, daring—
sharp splinter(s) of a whole,
s(t)retched on a frame of timeless (echoes)

ambition’s phoenix—inextinguishable, (f)iery plumes—
ignites each (morn), a (new) beating of glacier blue wings,
a me(l)ody shared among scattered for(e)vers,
throbbing lifeblood—unit(e)s the fragmented "I am" with "I will be,"
