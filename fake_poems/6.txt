Broken petals of truth—
Scattered in a wild dance of
chaos(their hearts, bleeding) 
colors unheard of,
whispers tangled in the
Breeze chatter with the
sun.

Whence cometh purity in an 
Era of deceit,
nested betwixt lines of 
sincere voices—
continuously muffled
by the cacophony of a world apostate.

Innocence, a phantom
in repose(eternally breathless),
waits beneath the ever-watchful
gaze of Father Time,

And in the still abyss, 
Hope—like a lone, resolute vessel—ascends,
reaching for the firmament: a silent symphony
in the theater of collective dreams.
