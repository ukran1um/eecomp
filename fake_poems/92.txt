ephemeral etchings—
scarbark’s encrypted tryst
silhouette(gasp of leaves)

interlaced, two shadows
weaving—unraveling skin(song)
hush-held crescendos

(pianissimo touch)
leaf-quilted serenade
autumn’s closing cadenza

inhale, overlapping
gossamer meshes (secrets)
exhale: one whisper

beneath antique azure
our osculation:
lexicon(elapsed) in cosmos
