Epoch churns—a cosmic wheel,
Whispers through the void doth steal;
An atom’s dance, both vast, precise,
‘Neath constellation's roll of dice.

Siren’s echo, time's own thrum,
Each dawn anew, old worlds become,
Dewdrop’s glisten on dawn’s petal,
Greet the light with softest settle.

Our helix twines essence stark—
Stellar dust ignites the dark,
A voyage cast on waves unseen,
Pursuit of dreams—life’s serene.

Alchemy of bone's breath,
Mysteries wear mortal sheath,
A hand in hand through void we soar,
Leaving footprints on time’s shore.

Speak silent—the universe contracts,
In gazes shared, a parallax;
From gales of past do laughter, cry,
In silence brew, await the sky.

Scribing on Time's soft-skinned slate,
Change twists the loom of fate,
In structured beat our days disperse,
An open verse; the universe.
