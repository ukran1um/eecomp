In the garden—my father’s cogitations lie,
here blooms a lily’s incandescent throbbing, 
beneath the shelter of ancestral murmurs and oaks.
Sky, thou weeper tender, gentle tears—but no,
for dew hath courted already morning’s tender flesh.

Roots entwined as veins, lifeblood of antiquity’s elixir
whistle tales as ancient as the hewn stone walkways,
witness to the absent footfalls of wandering echoes.
Gossamer—delicate, captures glinting sun’s stolen kiss,
a trawler’s net seeking dawn’s diamond beguilements.

In this place—time’s embrace in hand-held unity,
lovers twirl to the whispered serenades of leaves,
exhaling breaths that ignite an unrivaled blaze,
a signal fire married amidst metamorphosis and constants.
And the world, a stage of perennial wilting and awakening.
