wi.thin the cradle of shadowed~leaves
a whispered:wish:weaves
b.e.t.w.e.e.n the curl_of_a foxglove’s embrace
and the\_gentle)sigh(of the earth’s grace

sun(light)da.nces on the water’s(edge,
wh[ere] ti^me h^olds a solemn [pledge,
to the lones}ome cal(l of the whippoor)will,
who sin.gs of love; sweet(and)still

under a tapestry of stories un_told,
( two ) hearts, in si...lence, un_fold;
in the quiet hush of the falling night,
they_find.a.love that.feels(just)right

but_as(dawn)breaks, a {tear}does_too,
for_love_is a painting of many a hue,
though the canvas may change, the essence_stays,
as_moments_ are_live_paintings_of_our_days.
