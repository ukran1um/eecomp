whir[l] of autumn
sepia-tone, whisper-ground
leaves: crisply surrendering a
ballet against, time's sound

harvested love within
crimson-bitten apple's
share: half sweet-glance
beneath time's subtle-dapple.

moon-crescent a memory boat
afloat on, night's sable sea
you&I silent notes in 
nocturne's, reverie.

embers of, summer lost
frost breath on window kiss
our lingering warmth traced
in cold season's, abyss

two threads in life's, grand loom
weaving through fateâ€™s firm-warp
a tapestry of bloom
'til eternity's sharp
