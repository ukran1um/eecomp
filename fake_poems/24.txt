a clover, an oddity—amongst blades whisper green
threefold yet unforths a hidden fourth in between
crepuscular twins and lunation's unseen
a tetra-spirit gambols on nightly dene

spiral galaxies fling stardust in darkness' spread,
cantillating ancient celestial thread.
yet Earth’s verdant triplet defies overhead,
eve's suitor in stillness, enigmatically bred.

not elfish miner nor hoarder of myths' ore,
a narrative renegade, recast folklore.
while green tongues wag, they endlessly lore,
'neath a parasol cosmos, where destinies pour.

searcher, art thou for the leaf of four,
adventuring salted seas, storied shore?
in silent sacred, alethia’s rapport,
solitude’s conclave, where oneness will soar.

oft the fortune-hunte—alone laments despair,
raking through green waves, dim-twilight's glare.
each leaf—potential throne of chance rare,
'til the longed-for—melds with seeker fair.
