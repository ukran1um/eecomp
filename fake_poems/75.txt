petal-wisdom, thorn-folly,
within love's intricate tessellation:
(filigree of interconnected hearts)

wind-cradled grain sways, whispers
underneath the lustrous gaze
of the ever-watchful harvest moon

our bodies—a cartographer’s dream,
you chart unknown (worlds within worlds)
as I unfold constellations across your skin

a (solitary) starling strikes the glass—
our tender crashing: a symphony
of fractured pieces finding their constellation

(night wraps) its velvet around us, we are
silhouettes tracing soft (sublimities in the dark)
breathing life into (hushed) celestial secrets

as the earth finishes one pirouette,
blossom (and wither) within the coils
of time's grand, unyielding ballet
