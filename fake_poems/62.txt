In twilight's hush, beneath the stoic fig,  
its limbs cradle eons, whispered through boughs,  
time—a painter mixing dust and dew drops—  
drapes each leaf with shadows' velvet touch,  

s(u
nder)e
d(b)ywh(isp)ers,o
f a(n)cien(t) lore

that dance upon the tongue of restless winds;  

beneath these branches, we, patchwork of souls—  
knit of earth's tender skein, hands dyed in dusk—  

vie(w) life, a marbled (canvas) emerge:
each pulse a hue, each sigh a stroke refined,

hear(t)thrum(s) weave (silent)tapestries of being,  
as colors blend in destiny's grand design.
