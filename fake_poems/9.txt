Where silence pirouettes, there
swish-whisperings of Time
—in its unsteady-
                                      ticKTocKs—narrate hours
that collapse and

unfurl

unseen.

Clouds, with strokes from a 
              weeping viola—laments in A-Minor,
are s t r e t c h e d across the canvas of
        the EVER
                  EXPANDING
sky,
a symphony of

                  [tempest]
                                &tranquility

In the grasp of hoarfrost, where might
roses dream? Beneath the
               whisper-thin shroud of ice,
               envisioning vibrant awakenings
               within the clutches of

hibernation’s

breath.

The sparrow, wings trimmed by the
serrated breeze,
                 aspires still for          heaven’s
                                           precarious perch.

Unuttered verses swirl
around the Quill, caged thrushes
                                          yearning
to unravel the
space between now &

the boundless expanse
