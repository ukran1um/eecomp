In night’s enigmatic clutch—‘neath lapis skies unfurled,  
we move—our feet, h u s h e d  
whisperers to the dark.  
Our arcane mistress  
Moon scatters Her spells  
above. She guides us through,  
m i s t e n g u l f e d dreams  
onward to   
destiny's mark.

Vexed spirits—  
c o b b l e s t o n e s ' cold skin breathe,  
Shadows teasingly pirouette—  
to whims of wayward drafts.  
Candlelight—a frenzy held within—  
a dervish swirling secrets into  
Night’s infinite, dark embrace.

Time weaves its silence into space’s web,  
Hearts beat—in sync with the cosmos'   
trembling embrace—  
Between epochs lost,  
among  
stars that lovers, feverishly  
t r a c e.

A tale of love—by the cosmos murmured,  
A fateful dance—where past and future  
fall  
fade  
themselves.
