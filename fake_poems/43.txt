Dancing shadows 'cross dreams, 
unfettered—dawn
Cobbled thoughts, bare, unstrung—
weary pawns
Whispers lace ether's silence,
tread by none
Fabric-time's unraveled, 
thread by scattered thread

Feathersteps amidst, chaos—
hearts tandem-beat
Canvas hopes, splash bittersweet
in defeat
Theatre of minds conflate, where
stories—solace seek
Verse solace craves, 
where broken arcs can mend

Invisible, weave manifest to—
wraith
Existence chiseling, whispers
into faith
Yet echoes, end sailing labyrinthine—
gale
Cosmic seas chart, 
where ancients' voices—wail
