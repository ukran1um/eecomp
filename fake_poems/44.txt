to stoke—the stardust—my marrowbone whispers
i chiseled at constellations—
piercèd black, with a sparrow’s quill—
delicate; adorations,

Bone/spun, spiral galaxies whorl—
@(murmur's flight)@
in veins, comets weave tales, fallacies—
burnthroughshroudednight

[thrum beneath skin-flutter]
(quiet mutter)
of universe—
breath's cosmic dust trail,
from flesh-nurseries & time-crested rust

Eyes, twin moons afloat—
(twin lakes ripple-stories untold)
Heart's transit; a solitary planet,
traipsing past life’s incandescent hold.

symphonic atoms—dance and twirl—
(cosmic joy, agleam)
Within, eternity, softly uttered—
universe in microcosm—stammering dream
