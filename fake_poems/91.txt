Leaves—
vein-traced sky parchment,
sketch secrets in chlorophyll ink.
Breath(taken)
by, the wind-a sibyl
whispering futures through the olive’s leaves.

Seeds s(own
across) Time’s
golden furrow-broken hearts-shed
like apple peel, hand(waxed)coiled
grips the core’s brief sweetness—bites to the bitter.

Within the womb of years, once was(is lost)
marketplace of memory, echo(e)s faded
tra(i)ding post for tales and sighs
bazaar of childhood’s ghosts,
parents’ clocks—and
laces and reckoning shadows.

Moon(drunk)roots
imbibe the whispered dew,
Love's renewal—a murmur below
the dance of dusk's last light.
Soli(tude) cradles the night's
soft exhale: a tomorrow born in dreams.
