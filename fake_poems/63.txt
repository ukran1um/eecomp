wherknots ofnightshadeplay,
secrecies of hushcascade,

and unspokensighs tame day

glissadeof sunon crumblingtones,
illuminates yesteryears' lace
whilst silenceinsilence atones
in the calmness time can't efface

beneathcrackswhere light sequesters,
shy whispersof pastlibations
linger as spectraljesters,
echoesof fading vibrations

time, in still repose, is bound
seizing apendulum, mutedâ€”
within its orbit, profound
pulsesof life, transmuted

here, essenceclings andcleaves,
to walls germinated with sound
