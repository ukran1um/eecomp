In splintered whispers, the willow wept,
to secrets of verdant vales untrodden by noon,
Silhouettes pirouette on the brink of dreams,
where time drips slow as honey from the moon.

Encoded in the DNA of fallen stars,
are tales too tender for the sun's harsh eye,
Galactic symphonies composed in silence,
spun from the loom where night skies sigh.

A canvas stretched across eternity,
daubed with the shades of centuries' sigh,
Humanity's mosaic, fractured yet whole—
the masterpiece of an existential why.

Underneath, the quiet thrum of Earth’s heart,
a rhythm primal, ancient as the stone,
A bassline to our fleeting, fervent lives,
mapping a journey through the unknown.

Where the thread of fate lies bare,
in the loom of time, we find our place,
Weaving strands of whispered yesterdays,
into the future's ever-unfolding grace.
