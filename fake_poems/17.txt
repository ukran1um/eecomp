     dawn-touched sky     _     bleeds
                            into
               the well of thought, where
    echoes  _(faint)  weave
        through whispering
                m i s t s

          silent     screeches, slip
              into the -stream - - -
    (i)llogical voids, plucked
           from shadows(our stage)

before     dim fires, specks of
           Ancient whispers    _
     tales unravel_(thread      by)
      thread       in the loom
      
      Sisyphus sighs, stones
            of                  r e a l i t y
            heaved upon unforgiving slopes
Heraclitus' streams     slip by, whisper:
                "never        the     same"
