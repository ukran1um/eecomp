under the eld  
time-storied & sky-basted  
I linger &  
leaf by leaf  
spectrums of flame  
lock on to desperate  
twig-tips—  
breath held  
in life's last  
stand  
 
river-song etch  
eternities past  
stones; smooth sentinels  
silent  
with memory's weight—a  
thousand rains' whispered  
legacy  

hark—an nightingale trills  
within  
nature's  
rustle  
'shadow tales of sun's retreat; there  
us meld into a singular silhouette  
two entangled  
within night's onset  
waging  
quiet  
war  

against the dusk  
our kiss; a cosmic spark  
to out-burn  
distant stars—  
we etch  
us deep  
beyond the marrow  
of all things; carving  
our  
fleeting yet endless  
dance  
into the universe's vast   
palms
