in this silent hamlet, I’ve watched
sunsets—sky’s anguish bleeding through
timbered silhouettes, a tableau hung
between whispers
of leaves: old missives of love,
unspent.

here, a blackbird weaves
a fugue into dusk's quietude—its notes,
threads through life’s fabric,
clinging like scent
of rain-kissed earth as dusk
strokes the horizon

afar, fields resonate with yesterdays,
time’s furrows
and relentless goodbyes,
each stem curtsies
heavy with the yesteryears—
hoarded, cradled in my hands'
fading album

aging heart perches
on my cuff; a laden bloom
upon too tender a branch, for the blush of vernal muses,
it conjures love's renewal and the form
of joy, shaped by one
who still knows to heed
the tales 
in the weeping willow's tears
